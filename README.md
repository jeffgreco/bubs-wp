Bubs gives you a fresh start to our projects, this is the WordPress version.

## Quickstart

1. Download and extract to your project: https://github.com/patronage/bubs/archive/master.zip
2. Run `composer install`, which will initialize the project.
3. There is a line at the top of .gitignore that excludes `wp-content/plugins/*` -- Remove that.
4. Follow the instructions in your `README.md`.
