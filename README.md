Bubs gives you a clean start to a WordPress project leveraging a few key pieces:

* Timber
* Gulp
* Local, Staging, and Production release environments

## Quickstart

1. Download and extract to your project: https://github.com/patronage/bubs-wp/archive/master.zip
2. Run `composer install`, which will initialize the project.
3. There is a line at the top of .gitignore that excludes `wp-content/plugins/*` -- Remove that.
4. You'll have a new top level `README.md` (it's copied from `_init/README.md`). Follow instructions in that file for customizing your project further.
